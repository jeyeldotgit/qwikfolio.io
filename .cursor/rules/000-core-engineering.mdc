# 🛠️ Engineering Core Rules

## MENTAL MODEL

- **Ship fast, but keep refactoring cheap.**
- **TypeScript protects boundaries; React composes behavior.**

## ARCHITECTURE

- **Pages:** Layout, Composition, Props only. NO API/Logic.
- **Hooks:** Own behavior, state transitions, and data fetching.
- **Services:** Pure logic. No React, no state.
- **Folder Structure:** `src/pages`, `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/services`, `src/schemas`, `src/types`, `src/lib`.

## IMPLEMENTATION

- **Files:** Max 200 lines if possible . Single responsibility.
- **Components:** Arrow syntax only. NO `React.FC`. Props must be explicitly typed.
- **TS:** NO `any`. Use unions over enums. Infer inside functions.
- **Forms:** Zod schemas are the single source of truth.
